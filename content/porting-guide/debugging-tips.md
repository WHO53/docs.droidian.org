Summary
-------

When porting a new device, you might (will) encounter some issues.
It's unlikely that everything will work fine at first boot, so strap in,
read this document twice and enjoy your ride.

Note that that this document assumes TWRP as the recovery used.

Pre boot tips
-------------

These things are worth checking first:

### Check size of the Droidian rootfs

Some recoveries might fail in resizing the Droidian rootfs. This will in turn
break the boot process (and eventual feature bundles installation) due to the
lack of available free space.

You can open a shell from your recovery (either via `adb shell` or with the built-in terminal) and check:

	(recovery)$ ls -lth /data/rootfs.img

if the image size is not 8GB, you can attempt resizing it manually:

	(recovery)$ e2fsck -fy /data/rootfs.img
	(recovery)$ resize2fs -f /data/rootfs.img 8G

### Devtools

Snapshot Droidian releases require the installation of the devtools feature bundle
to get useful tools to aid debugging, including an SSH server and tools required
to expose it via RNDIS.

Devtools will also force the systemd journal to be flushed to disk, so that eventual
logs might be looked for in recovery.

Nightly releases embed devtools on the rootfs. If you have trouble installing devtools
on a snapshot release, consider trying a nightly image so that you don't need to install
it separatedly.

### Double-check cmdline for the `systempart=` option

If you're re-using the same boot image from Ubuntu Touch, you might have the
`systempart=` option in the kernel cmdline. This might lead to Android/Ubuntu Touch booting rather than Droidian

Unlike Ubuntu Touch, Droidian doesn't use the existing system partition for the
rootfs. Thus, if you have the `systempart=` kernel option, remove it and recompile
your kernel (or otherwise remove it from the bootimage using tools like yabit or
Android Image Kitchen).

If your device reboots immediately, you should try the these few systemd sections

### Booting to fastboot

For an unknown reason, some devices fail to boot with an arm64 ramdisk (yggdrasil and sargo are prone to this issue)

To use the armhf ramdisk for your device, [this](https://github.com/droidian-devices/linux-android-google-sargo/blob/droidian/debian/rules) `debian/rules` file should be used instead of the one used by default
and `linux-initramfs-halium-generic:armhf` should be added to `debian/kernel-info.mk` then regenerate `debian/control` and rebuild the kernel.

### initramfs not finding the userdata partition
If device gets stuck in initramfs (you'll see Failed to boot in dmesg of your host), one possibility is that initramfs cannot find the userdata partition.

To fix this `datapart=` can be added to the cmdline.

The value of datapart should be either `/dev/disk/by-partlabel/userdata` or the exact label and number of that partition such as `/dev/sda23` (which is device specific).

### initramfs refusing to find /init on target filesystem
Halium requires to have console= to be a console device. For some devices default cmdline extracted from stock boot image might have console= boot argument that conflicts with what halium expects, in that case halium will refuse to start /init.
If your device restarts right after booting the kernel and your boot cmdline has something like "console=ttyMSM0,115200n8" replace it with "console=tty0" and rebuild kernel.

### Mask journald

Some devices have trouble with systemd-journald (notably the Exynos 9810 and Exynos 9820 devices). You might try masking it via recovery.

Note that masking journald will disable log collection, so other issues will be harder to debug.

	(recovery)$ mkdir /tmp/mpoint
	(recovery)$ mount /data/rootfs.img /tmp/mpoint
	(recovery)$ chroot /tmp/mpoint /bin/bash
	(recovery)$ export PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/sbin
	(recovery)$ systemctl mask systemd-journald

### Check systemd journal for clues

If you haven't masked journald, and have devtools (or a nightly image) installed, you can check the systemd journal:

	(recovery)$ mkdir /tmp/mpoint
	(recovery)$ mount /data/rootfs.img /tmp/mpoint
	(recovery)$ chroot /tmp/mpoint /bin/bash
	(recovery)$ export PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/sbin
	(recovery)$ journalctl --no-pager

If you are stuck at the glowing Droidian logo and RNDIS is not working, you should into your kernel config to make sure `CONFIG_USB_CONFIGFS_RNDIS` is enabled.

It should also be noted that you should check the pstore section of the [kernel compilation](./kernel-compilation.md) guide.

If you have devtools installed (or have flashed a nightly image) but still don't have working RNDIS, these tips might help you:

### Mask resolved and timesyncd

Some kernels (Exynos kernels are known to have this issue) have trouble with the kernel namespaces systemd creates to run some
daemons, like timesyncd and resolved. This might make the boot process hang.

You might try masking those two services via a recovery shell:

	(recovery)$ mkdir /tmp/mpoint
	(recovery)$ mount /data/rootfs.img /tmp/mpoint
	(recovery)$ chroot /tmp/mpoint /bin/bash
	(recovery)$ export PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/sbin
	(recovery)$ systemctl mask systemd-resolved
	(recovery)$ systemctl mask systemd-timesyncd

### Disable the Halium container

Some vendor scripts might conflict with the usb-tethering script used to set-up the RNDIS connection.

You can disable the Halium container startup with the following:

	(recovery)$ mkdir /tmp/mpoint
	(recovery)$ mount /data/rootfs.img /tmp/mpoint
	(recovery)$ chroot /tmp/mpoint /bin/bash
	(recovery)$ export PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/sbin
	(recovery)$ nano /etc/systemd/system/lxc@android.service

Comment the ExecStartPre and ExecStart lines, add

`ExecStart=/bin/true`

save, sync and reboot

### Setup connection via WLAN

You might try pre-configuring your WLAN device and attempt getting in via WLAN rather than RNDIS:

	(recovery)$ mkdir /tmp/mpoint
	(recovery)$ mount /data/rootfs.img /tmp/mpoint
	(recovery)$ chroot /tmp/mpoint /bin/bash
	(recovery)$ export PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/sbin
	(recovery)$ nano /etc/network/interfaces

and put the following there:

```
auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet dhcp
  wpa-ssid SSID
  wpa-psk PASSWORD
```

where SSID is your AP SSID, and PASSWORD is your password.

You can also use a static configuration if you prefer:

```
auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet static
  wpa-ssid SSID
  wpa-psk PASSWORD
  address <ip>
  netmask <netmask>
  gateway <gw>
```

Reboot, and if everything went smoothly you can try getting in with `ssh droidian@$IP`.

If you configured using DHCP, you should check among your DHCP server leases.

The default password is `1234`.

### ssh saying system is still booting

To make ssh ignore systemd complaining, [this service file](https://github.com/droidian-devices/adaptation-droidian-angelica/blob/droidian/debian/adaptation-angelica-configs.ssh-fix.service) can added in recovery

	(recovery)$ mkdir /tmp/mpoint
	(recovery)$ mount /data/rootfs.img /tmp/mpoint
	(recovery)$ chroot /tmp/mpoint /bin/bash
	(recovery)$ export PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/sbin
	(recovery)$ nano /etc/systemd/system

Put the content of the service file

	(recovery)$ systemctl enable ssh-fix

Tips for when the systen is booted with shell
---------------------------------------------

**Before proceeding, read the previous section, those tips might be useful as well.**

**NOTE THAT EVERY COMMAND IN THIS SECTION IMPLIES ROOT PRIVILEGES UNLESS EXPLICITLY SPECIFIED**

You can start a root shell with

	(device)$ sudo -i

### USB Networking

To share your hosts network connection with your device you can use the following on your host

	(host)$ sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
	(host)$ sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o $INTERNET -j MASQUERADE
	(host)$ sudo iptables -A FORWARD -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
	(host)$ sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i $USB -o $INTERNET -j ACCEPT

$USB is the interface connected to your device, most likely `usb0`

$INTERNET is the interface connected to the internet.

Then run the following on your device

	(device)$ sudo ip route add default via 10.15.19.100

The ip address `10.15.19.100` is your host. Double check it before running the command.

Now to access the internet replace the content of `/etc/resolv.conf` with `nameserver 8.8.8.8`.

### Umount schedtune

Schedtune must be disabled for Droidian to work, but some device kernels complain
about that. So the workaround is to umount schedtune at boot:

	(device)# mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/android-mount.service.d
	(device)# nano /etc/systemd/system/android-mount.service.d/10-schedtune.conf

add this there:

```
[Service]
ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/umount -l /sys/fs/cgroup/schedtune
```

save and reboot

### Ensure the Halium container is running

You can use

	(device)# lxc-ls --fancy

to check if the Halium container is running

### Launch the Halium container manually

If the Halium container is not running, you might try launching it manually:

	(device)# lxc-start -n android --logfile=/tmp/lxclog --logpriority=DEBUG

then check `/tmp/lxclog`.

### Re-generate udev rules

If the container is running, but you still haven't booted up to UI, you might try regenerating the udev rules

	(device)# DEVICE=codename # replace with your device codename
	(device)# cat /var/lib/lxc/android/rootfs/ueventd*.rc /var/lib/lxc/android/rootfs/system/etc/ueventd*.rc /vendor/ueventd*.rc | grep ^/dev | sed -e 's/^\/dev\///' | awk '{printf "ACTION==\"add\", KERNEL==\"%s\", OWNER=\"%s\", GROUP=\"%s\", MODE=\"%s\"\n",$1,$3,$4,$2}' | sed -e 's/\r//' >/etc/udev/rules.d/70-$DEVICE.rules

Then reboot.

### Check if test_hwcomposer works

Trying the `test_hwcomposer` command might be an useful test to check if the Android composer works.

Note that on Halium 10/11 devices you might need to restart the Android composer service after
using a client like test_hwcomposer or phoc itself. You can kill the `android.service.composer` process, it will be
respawned by the android init automatically.

### Make the Phosh service wait some seconds before start-up

Sometimes Phosh might attempt its startup even when the Android composer service is not ready (even if it signals so itself).

This is a bug, and you can workaround that by making the phosh service (which starts the compositor) wait some seconds:

	(device)# mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/phosh.service.d/
	(device)# nano /etc/systemd/system/phosh.service.d/90-wait.conf

and put this there:

```
# FIXME
[Service]
ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/sleep 5
```

Save and reboot.

### Vendor is not mounted

It is possible that the vendor partition doesn't get mounted by init and as a result the Halium contianer cannot start much of the services.

First off check if the vendor image is mounted

	(device)# ls /vendor

If it's empty then it is not mounted by init. Try mounting it manually by finding the partition in `/dev/disk/by-partlabel` and `/dev/block/bootdevice/by-name`.

If it is not there then you'll need to search `/dev` for your vendor partition.

Then to test it out, in `/var/lib/lxc/android/pre-start.sh` add the following under the `# Halium 9` section

```
mkdir -p /var/lib/lxc/android/rootfs/vendor
mount /dev/mmcblk0pYOURVENDOR /vendor
mount --bind /vendor /var/lib/lxc/android/rootfs/vendor
```

And reboot

Make sure to come back to this issue later to find a proper solution.

### lxc@android and phosh started but no output

If phosh and lxc@android have started with udev rules in plcae but there is no output on the screen, it is possible that vndservicemanager is crashing.

On some Halium 10 devices, a patched version of vndservicemanager might be used to have vndservicemanager start. a patched version of vndservicemanager can be found [here](https://github.com/droidian-devices/adaptation-droidian-starqlte/blob/droidian/usr/lib/droid-vendor-overlay/bin/vndservicemanager).

	(device)# mkdir -p /usr/lib/droid-vendor-overlay/bin/
	(device)# cp vndservicemanager /usr/lib/droid-vendor-overlay/bin/

Reboot

### Long boot times

If you are encountering long boot times, you can try inspecting kernel logs and check what process was keeping the system from booting up

	(device)# dmesg

To figure out which part of the boot process is causing the issue

	(device)# systemd-analyze

Tips for when the system is up with Phosh
-----------------------------------------

### Screen brightness

On some Qualcomm devices, screen brightness is always set to 0 on boot via hwcomposer. to work around this issue brightness can be set to maximum on each boot

	(device)$ echo 2047 > /sys/class/leds/lcd-backlight/brightness

It can also be set as a service to start at boot like [this service file](https://github.com/droidian-devices/adaptation-droidian-lavender/blob/droidian/debian/adaptation-lavender-configs.brightness.service).

### Brightness adjusting from drop down menu

On some devices, vendor sets the wrong permission for the brightness sysfs node at boot so Phosh cannot access and modify it.

A service like [this](https://github.com/droidian-devices/adaptation-droidian-onclite/blob/droidian/debian/adaptation-onclite-configs.brightnessperm.service) can be used to set the correct permission or at least give the user droidian access to the sysfs node

Make sure to replace the brightness node according to your needs.

### Phosh scaling

Phosh might have the wrong scaling set. phoc.ini should be created to adjust it

	(device)# mkdir -p /etc/phosh/
	(device)# nano phoc.ini

and put [phoc.ini](https://github.com/droidian-devices/adaptation-droidian-miatoll/blob/droidian/etc/phosh/phoc.ini)

the value for `output:HWCOMPOSER-1` can be adjusted as needed.

### vendor parititon overlay

To overlay a file over the vendor partition, `droid-vendor-overlay` directory can be used

	(device)# mkdir -p /usr/lib/droid-vendor-overlay

and the your files can be added here. take [this](https://github.com/droidian-devices/adaptation-fxtec-pro1x/tree/bookworm/sparse/usr/lib/droid-vendor-overlay) as a reference.

It should be noted that the directory structure matters.

### system partition overlay

To overlay a file over the system partition, `droid-system-overlay` directory can be used

	(device)# mkdir -p /usr/lib/droid-system-overlay

and the your files can be added here. take [this](https://github.com/droidian-devices/adaptation-fxtec-pro1x/tree/droidian/sparse/usr/lib/droid-system-overlay) as a reference.

It should be noted that the directory structure matters.

### Bluetooth crashing

Bluetooth might crash because of missing MAC Address. To make the bluetooth service ignore it this hack can be used

	(device)# mkdir -p /var/lib/bluetooth/
	(device)# touch /var/lib/bluetooth/board-address

For a proper solution, a `droid-get-bt-address.sh` script which fetches the correct address should be created.

An example of this solution can be found at [here](https://github.com/droidian-devices/adaptation-google-sargo/blob/droidian/usr/bin/droid/droid-get-bt-address.sh) or [here](https://github.com/droidian-devices/adaptation-droidian-oneplus3/blob/droidian/usr/bin/droid/droid-get-bt-address.sh) for Qualcomm's
and [here](https://github.com/droidian-devices/adaptation-droidian-angelica/blob/droidian/usr/bin/droid/droid-get-bt-address.sh) for MediaTek's.

### Bluetooth not available in settings

Bluetooth might fail to appear in `gnome-control-center` for various reasons.

It can be tested with `bluetoothctl` or `blueman`

	(device)$ bluetoothctl
	[bluetooth]# scan on

or to install blueman

	(device)# apt install blueman

A new package called btscanner-gcc is also available in case settings does show the bluetooth section but no devices under that section

	(device)# apt install btscanner-gcc

Now bluetooth should be available after a reboot

### Audio adjusting not working

on MediaTek devices, pulseaudio requires a custom configuration file which can be found [here](https://github.com/droidian-devices/adaptation-droidian-angelica/blob/droidian/etc/pulse/arm_droid_card_custom.pa).

### Custom hostname

To set a custom hostname on boot, a preferred hostname file can be created

	(device)# mkdir -p /usr/lib/droidian/device/
	(device)# nano preferred-hostname

And put your device model or codename without any spaces.

### Cursor on the screen

Some devices have an some HID interfaces which are not used by Droidian. These interfaces might get registered as things such as keyboard or mouse.

As a result you might see a cursor on the screen for no obvious reason.

To find information about the input device, `libinput-tools` can be installed and used

	(device)# apt install libinput-tools

To get a list of all devices

	(device)# libinput list-devices

To monitor inputs

	(device)# libinput debug-events

To hide this event node a udev rule can be added

`ACTION=="add|change", KERNEL=="event1", OWNER="root", GROUP="system", MODE="0666", ENV{LIBINPUT_IGNORE_DEVICE}="1"`

to `/etc/udev/rules.d/71-hide.rules`.

Make sure to adapt the event node in this line from `event1` to your input device and reboot.

### Encryption support

To test out encryption first create an empty file in `/usr/lib/droidian/device/encryption-supported` then open the encryption app.


	(device)# mkdir -p /usr/lib/droidian/device/
	(device)# touch /usr/lib/droidian/device/encryption-supported


If after enabling encryption device can be unlocked without any issues then keep the file. else remove it

### Camera support

In case of camera not functioning on the target device, it would be a good idea to check if [this commit](https://github.com/droidian-devices/linux-android-xiaomi-lavender/commit/a6218388caa8716fff413dc6c9d88b73be426362) is present in your kernel.

It is known to break camera on devices. if it is present, it should be reverted in the kernel.

Both of Droidian's camera stacks should be tested. one uses droidcamsrc available as pinhole and the other is aal available as droidian-camera.

To install and use pinhole (which uses droidcamsrc):

	(device)# apt install pinhole -y

to install droidian-camera:

	(device)# apt install droidian-camera -y

### Waydroid cgroups error

On some devices, waydroid will fail to start due to some cgroups issues. `systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=0` can be added to kernel cmdline to work around this issue.

### Force flashlight to use sysfs

To force the flashlight daemon to use sysfs, an empty file with the name `/usr/lib/droidian/device/flashlightd-sysfs` can be created. sysfs tends to be faster on starting flashlight.

### Add sysfs flashlight node

To add a sysfs flashlight nodes, a comma separated file at `/usr/lib/droidian/device/flashlightd-sysfs-nodes`

The syntax looks like the following

```
/path/to/node,/path/to/node2
```

### System performance

On some Qualcomm devices (such as lavender and sargo), Android thermal engine service will slow down the system and keep cpu cores offline.

This service can be disabled via a vendor overlay of android init files to disable the service. [These few lines](https://github.com/droidian-devices/adaptation-droidian-lavender/blob/droidian/usr/lib/droid-vendor-overlay/etc/init/init.target.rc#L226-229) can be taken as reference.

### Noise during calls

In case of voice calls being noisey, the value of `persist.audio.fluence.voicecall` can be adjusted using setprop. acceptable values are `true` and `false`

	(device)# setprop persist.audio.fluence.voicecall false

### Battery and suspend

Traditional suspend is broken on Android kernels, as a result Droidian uses batman to allow for battery management which is enabled by default.

Traditional suspend wakes up the device every now and then without actually suspending. this behaviour can be disabled with [this](https://github.com/droidian-devices/adaptation-droidian-starqlte/blob/droidian/usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/10_disable-suspend.gschema.override) schema override file.

Disabling it won't do any harm to the system as batman is the main daemon in charge of battery management on Droidian.

### MTP

MTP support is available since trixie and can be enabled with

	(device)# touch /usr/lib/droidian/device/mtp-supported

Now MTP can be enabled from settings after a reboot.

### Cutout and punch hole fixes

Droidian will attempt to automatically generate config files on startup to fix issues of cutout and punch holes

In case the info is not generated or not usable for any reason, a custom version can be added at `/usr/lib/droidian/device/phosh-notch/halium.json`.

Refer to [gmobile documentation](https://phosh.mobi/posts/notch-support/) for more info on how to generate a correct json file manually.
